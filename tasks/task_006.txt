# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement AI Gateway Integration Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create dedicated component for AI Gateway setup, model management, and unified provider access.
# Details:
1. Create `ConciergusAIGateway` component for AI Gateway integration
2. Implement model switching and fallback chain management
3. Add cost optimization and performance monitoring
4. Create TypeScript interfaces:
```typescript
interface ConciergusAIGatewayProps {
  models?: string[];
  fallbackChain?: string[];
  costOptimization?: boolean;
  onModelChange?: (model: string) => void;
  onCostUpdate?: (cost: number) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```
5. Integration with Vercel OIDC authentication
6. Support for real-time model performance comparison
7. Add debugging and monitoring tools for model usage

# Test Strategy:
Test model switching across different providers. Verify fallback chains work correctly. Test cost tracking and optimization. Verify authentication with Vercel OIDC tokens.
