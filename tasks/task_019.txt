   - Create starter templates for different frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Build step-by-step tutorials with working code
   - Ensure examples follow best practices

4. Interactive Playground:
   - Design and implement interactive demo environments
   - Create CodeSandbox and StackBlitz templates
   - Build a live playground on the documentation site
   - Include editable examples with real-time preview

5. Code Generation Tools:

   - Implement wizards for configuration generation
   - Provide CLI tools for scaffolding new projects

6. Plugin/Extension Architecture:
   - Design a flexible plugin system for library customization
   - Document extension points and interfaces
   - Create example plugins demonstrating extensibility
   - Build tools to help developers create their own plugins

7. Community Contribution Tools:
   - Design and implement contribution guidelines
   - Create templates for issues and pull requests
   - Build automated testing and validation for contributions
   - Develop documentation for the contribution workflow

Dependencies:
- Security infrastructure must be in place (Task 13) to ensure proper authentication and authorization
- Core chat functionality (Task 16) must be complete as many developer tools will interact with these features

Technical Stack:
- TypeScript for library and tooling
- React for interactive documentation and demos
- TypeDoc for API documentation
- MDX for guides and tutorials

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task will be comprehensive and multi-layered:

1. Documentation Testing:
   - Validate TypeDoc generation against actual library behavior
   - Ensure all functions, types, and interfaces are accurately documented
   - Verify documentation is accessible and renders correctly
   - Test documentation examples with actual library usage

2. TypeScript Testing:
   - Create automated tests for type definitions
   - Test type inference and compatibility
   - Verify exported types match implementation
   - Test type utilities in different scenarios

3. Example Application Testing:
   - Verify all example applications build and run correctly
   - Test starter templates in different environments
   - Ensure tutorials can be followed without errors
   - Validate examples against library updates

4. Interactive Playground Testing:
   - Test playground functionality across browsers
   - Verify code editing and preview capabilities
   - Test integration with documentation
   - Ensure examples load and execute correctly

5. Code Generation Testing:
   - Test generated code for correctness and best practices
   - Verify templates produce functional code
   - Test CLI tools for usability and error handling
   - Validate generated code against library updates

6. Plugin Architecture Testing:
   - Test plugin loading and execution
   - Verify extension points work as documented
   - Test example plugins for functionality
   - Validate plugin development tools

7. Community Contribution Testing:
   - Test contribution workflows with sample PRs
   - Verify automated testing for contributions
   - Test issue and PR templates
   - Validate documentation for contributors

Success Criteria:
- All developer tools are fully functional and documented
- Developers can easily adopt and extend the library
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- Example applications demonstrate best practices
- Community contribution process is clear and accessible

# Subtasks:
