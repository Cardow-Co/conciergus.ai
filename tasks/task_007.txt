# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Advanced AI SDK 5 Hooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create enhanced hooks that leverage AI SDK 5 Alpha's advanced features for chat, agents, and streaming.
# Details:
1. Create `useConciergusChat` - wrapper around AI SDK 5's ChatStore
2. Implement `useConciergusAgent` - advanced agent control with step management
3. Add `useConciergusModels` - dynamic model switching and fallback management
4. Create `useConciergusMetrics` - usage analytics and performance monitoring
5. Implement `useConciergusRAG` - integration with AI SDK's embeddings API
6. Add `useConciergusObjectStream` - structured data streaming
7. Create TypeScript interfaces for all hooks
8. Integration with AI SDK 5's `prepareStep` and `continueUntil` features

# Test Strategy:
Test all hooks with AI SDK 5 Alpha features. Verify agent control works correctly. Test streaming hooks with real-time data. Verify metrics collection and RAG integration.
