# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement ConciergusToolUIRenderer Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a component that renders UI for function calls and tool invocations from the Vercel AI SDK.
# Details:
1. Create a `ConciergusToolUIRenderer` component that renders UI based on function calls
2. Implement support for Vercel AI SDK's tool_calls format
3. Add patterns for rendering buttons, forms, and carousels
4. Create TypeScript interface:
```typescript
interface ConciergusToolUIRendererProps {
  toolCalls: ToolCall[]; // From Vercel AI SDK
  onToolCallSubmit: (toolCallId: string, result: any) => void;
  className?: string;
  customRenderers?: Record<string, React.ComponentType<any>>;
  [key: string]: any; // For ...rest props
}
```
5. Implement default renderers for common tool types
6. Add support for custom renderers via props
7. Handle loading and error states
8. Implement proper accessibility for interactive elements

# Test Strategy:
Test rendering of various tool call types. Verify custom renderers work correctly. Test submission of tool call results. Verify accessibility of rendered UI elements. Test error handling with malformed tool calls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Component Structure and TypeScript Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic component structure and implement the TypeScript interface for ConciergusToolUIRenderer
### Details:
Create the component file with proper TypeScript interface as specified in the requirements. Implement the component skeleton that accepts toolCalls, onToolCallSubmit, className, customRenderers, and other props. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle to ensure the component focuses only on rendering UI based on tool calls.

## 2. Implement Parent-Child Component Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design the component hierarchy with proper parent-child relationships for different tool call renderers
### Details:
Create a container/presentational pattern where ConciergusToolUIRenderer acts as the parent container managing the overall structure and data flow, while child components handle specific UI elements for different tool types. Establish clear communication patterns between parent and child components following React's unidirectional data flow.

## 3. Develop Default Renderers for Common Tool Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create default renderer components for buttons, forms, carousels, and other common UI patterns
### Details:
Implement reusable child components that render specific UI elements based on tool call types. Each renderer should follow the Single Responsibility Principle, focusing on one specific functionality. Create components for buttons, forms, carousels, and other UI patterns mentioned in the requirements.

## 4. Implement Custom Renderer Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Add functionality to allow custom renderers to be passed via props and override default renderers
### Details:
Create a mechanism to register and use custom renderers passed via the customRenderers prop. Implement logic to check for custom renderers before falling back to default ones. Ensure the component can handle any type of custom renderer that follows the expected interface.

## 5. Add State Management and Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Implement loading and error states, and ensure proper accessibility for all interactive elements
### Details:
Add state management for loading and error conditions when processing tool calls. Implement proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, and other accessibility features for all interactive elements. Ensure the component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines and is fully accessible to users with disabilities.
