Use this for rendering the message in the UI.\n   * Assistant messages can have text, reasoning and tool invocation parts.\n   * User messages can have text parts.\n   */\n  parts: Array<\n    | TextUIPart\n    | ReasoningUIPart\n    | ToolInvocationUIPart\n    | SourceUIPart\n    | FileUIPart\n    | StepStartUIPart\n  >;\n};\n```\n\n### Message Base Interface\n```typescript\nexport interface Message {\n  id: string;\n  createdAt?: Date;\n  content: string; // Still exists but use parts when possible\n  role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant' | 'data';\n  parts?: Array<...>; // Optional on Message, required on UIMessage\n}\n```\n\n### Part Types\n- `TextUIPart`: `{ type: 'text'; text: string; }`\n- `ReasoningUIPart`: `{ type: 'reasoning'; reasoning: string; details: Array<...> }`\n- `ToolInvocationUIPart`: `{ type: 'tool-invocation'; toolInvocation: ToolInvocation; }`\n- `SourceUIPart`: `{ type: 'source'; source: LanguageModelV1Source; }`\n- `FileUIPart`: `{ type: 'file'; mimeType: string; data: string; }`\n- `StepStartUIPart`: `{ type: 'step-start'; }`\n\n### Implementation Notes\n1.
