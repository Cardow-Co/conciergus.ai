# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with Automated Testing for Production Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automates testing, building, and publishing the library to NPM and other distribution channels with proper documentation and contributor tooling.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure reliable and consistent library releases:

1. **Package Management and Versioning**:
   - Implement Changesets for versioning and changelog generation
   - Configure NPM package publishing workflow
   - Set up semantic versioning enforcement
   - Manage package.json configuration for proper library exports

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tool
   - Configure automated testing on pull requests (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Implement linting and code quality checks
   - Set up automated builds and type generation
   - Configure publishing to NPM and other distribution channels

3. **Documentation Infrastructure**:
   - Integrate TypeDoc for API documentation generation
   - Set up Storybook for component demos and examples
   - Implement documentation website deployment
   - Configure automated documentation updates on releases

4. **Distribution and CDN**:
   - Configure package bundling for various module formats (ESM, CJS, UMD)
   - Set up CDN publishing for browser-direct usage
   - Implement tree-shaking optimizations
   - Configure package size monitoring

5. **Contributor Environment**:
   - Set up development environment documentation
   - Create contributor guidelines and templates
   - Implement testing infrastructure for multiple Node.js versions
   - Configure example applications and demos

Reference best practices for open source JavaScript/TypeScript libraries throughout implementation. Ensure all security measures from Task 13 are properly integrated into the build and release pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
The CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure implementation should be verified through the following testing approach:

1. **Pipeline Verification**:
   - Verify that all CI/CD stages (build, test, publish) complete successfully
   - Confirm that failed tests properly prevent releases
   - Test version bumping and changelog generation with Changesets
   - Verify that the pipeline correctly handles environment variables and secrets

2. **Package Testing**:
   - Test package installation from NPM in various projects
   - Verify that the package can be imported in different module systems
   - Test tree-shaking effectiveness in example applications
   - Verify that TypeScript types are correctly exported and usable

3. **Documentation Testing**:
   - Verify TypeDoc generates complete and accurate API documentation
   - Test Storybook examples across different browsers
   - Verify documentation site deploys correctly and is accessible
   - Test example applications to ensure they work with the latest release

4. **Multi-environment Testing**:
   - Test library compatibility across multiple Node.js versions
   - Verify browser compatibility in different environments
   - Test integration with popular frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Verify package works in both development and production modes

5. **Contributor Experience Testing**:
   - Test the contributor setup process with new developers
   - Verify that development environment can be set up following documentation
   - Test pull request workflows and automated checks
   - Verify that example applications can be used for development testing

Document all test results and create guides for common contribution workflows and release procedures.
