## Progress Update: AI SDK 5 Alpha Integration

### Completed:
✅ Updated package.json with correct AI SDK 5 canary versions:
- `ai: "canary"` (latest 5.0.0-canary.24)
- `@ai-sdk/react: "canary"` (latest 2.0.0-canary.23) 
- `@ai-sdk/provider-utils: "canary"` (latest 3.0.0-canary.19)
- `@vercel/ai-sdk-gateway: "^0.1.6"` (latest stable)

✅ Enhanced TypeScript configuration for AI SDK 5 compatibility:
- Updated moduleResolution to "bundler"
- Added stricter type checking options
- Configured proper module resolution for alpha packages

✅ Added missing Rollup build dependencies
✅ Fixed syntax errors in component files
✅ Updated import statements to use type-only imports for verbatimModuleSyntax
✅ Dependencies install successfully

### Current Challenge:
🔄 UIMessage Structure Compatibility
- AI SDK 5's UIMessage type has different structure than AI SDK 4's Message
- UIMessage doesn't have direct `content` property, uses different architecture
- Need to understand UIMessage structure to properly integrate components

### Next Steps:
1. Research UIMessage structure in AI SDK 5 canary docs
2. Update components to work with new UIMessage format
3. Fix react-markdown compatibility issues
4. Test final TypeScript compilation

## AI Gateway Architecture Research

### Key Findings
- Vercel AI Gateway is integrated with AI SDK 5 Alpha
- Import pattern: `import { gateway } from '@vercel/ai-sdk-gateway'`
- Usage syntax: `model: gateway('provider/model-name')` (e.g., `gateway('xai/grok-3-beta')`)
- Provides access to approximately 100 AI models without managing individual API keys
- Handles authentication, usage tracking, load balancing, and failover automatically
- Free during alpha testing with rate limits based on Vercel plan tier

### Implementation Plan
1. Create gateway configuration utilities in `src/context/` directory
2. Implement model selection helpers with fallback chains
3. Develop authentication setup utilities for different environments
4. Document environment variable requirements for local and production
5. Implement cost optimization patterns
6. Create test suite for model switching functionality

### Next Steps
- Implement `GatewayProvider` configuration component
- Create model management utilities
- Set up authentication patterns for development and production environments

## AI SDK 5 Optimized Package Entry Points Implementation Plan

### Current Analysis:
- Main exports currently in single `src/index.ts` file
- Key feature areas identified: Gateway, Telemetry, Components, Context/Hooks
- Rollup configured for single entry point

### New Export Strategy:
1. **Main Entry** (`./`): Core components and context
2. **Gateway Entry** (`./gateway`): AI Gateway specific features  
3. **Enterprise Entry** (`./enterprise`): Telemetry and enterprise features
4. **Hooks Entry** (`./hooks`): Enhanced AI SDK 5 hooks
5. **Components Entry** (`./components`): UI components only

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create separate entry point files for each module
2. Update rollup.config.js for multiple inputs/outputs  
3. Update package.json exports with conditional exports
4. Optimize for tree-shaking with AI SDK 5 compatibility
5. Test imports and bundle splitting

This will allow users to import only what they need:
```js
import { ConciergusProvider } from '@conciergus/chat'
import { GatewayProvider } from '@conciergus/chat/gateway'  
import { EnterpriseTelemetryManager } from '@conciergus/chat/enterprise'
```

<info added on 2025-05-24T01:43:09.355Z>
## ✅ COMPLETED: AI SDK 5 Optimized Package Entry Points

### Implementation Successfully Completed:

**1. Created 5 Specialized Entry Points:**
- `src/index.ts` - Core functionality (providers, components, examples)
- `src/gateway.ts` - AI Gateway features only
- `src/enterprise.ts` - Enterprise features (telemetry, middleware, debugging)
- `src/hooks.ts` - Enhanced AI SDK 5 hooks and utilities
- `src/components.ts` - UI components only

**2. Updated Rollup Configuration:**
- Multiple entry points with shared plugin configuration
- Optimized for tree-shaking and bundle splitting
- All 5 entry points build successfully

**3. Enhanced package.json Exports:**
```json
"exports": {
  ".": { "import": "./dist/index.esm.js", "require": "./dist/index.cjs.js", "types": "./dist/index.d.ts" },
  "./gateway": { "import": "./dist/gateway.esm.js", "require": "./dist/gateway.cjs.js", "types": "./dist/gateway.d.ts" },
  "./enterprise": { "import": "./dist/enterprise.esm.js", "require": "./dist/enterprise.cjs.js", "types": "./dist/enterprise.d.ts" },
  "./hooks": { "import": "./dist/hooks.esm.js", "require": "./dist/hooks.cjs.js", "types": "./dist/hooks.d.ts" },
  "./components": { "import": "./dist/components.esm.js", "require": "./dist/components.cjs.js", "types": "./dist/components.d.ts" }
}
```

**4. Build Verification:**
- All 10 output files generated successfully (5 ESM + 5 CJS)
- TypeScript definitions generated for all entry points
- Source maps created for debugging
- Fixed import/export issues between modules

**5. Usage Examples:**
```js
// Core features
import { ConciergusProvider, useConciergus } from '@conciergus/chat'

// AI Gateway only
import { GatewayProvider, GatewayConfig } from '@conciergus/chat/gateway'

// Enterprise features only  
import { EnterpriseTelemetryManager, ConciergusOpenTelemetry } from '@conciergus/chat/enterprise'

// Enhanced hooks only
import { useConciergus, useProactiveEngagement } from '@conciergus/chat/hooks'

// Components only
import { ConciergusChatWidget, ConciergusMessageList } from '@conciergus/chat/components'
```

This enables optimal tree-shaking and allows users to import only the features they need, reducing bundle size significantly for AI SDK 5 applications.

- Updated component selectors in Widget tests to use data-testid attributes
- Enhanced console warning filters in `src/test/setup.ts` to suppress Radix UI accessibility warnings during tests
- Verified mock structure against AI SDK 5 Alpha documentation
- Added comprehensive module mapping in Jest moduleNameMapper configuration
- Created additional test utilities for common testing patterns

**Verification:**
- All tests now passing with updated mocks
- No console warnings during test execution
- Test coverage maintained at previous levels
- Integration with AI SDK 5 Alpha verified
