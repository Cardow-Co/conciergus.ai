# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement React Server Components (RSC) Integration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create optional RSC package for server-side AI generation and generative UI capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create `@conciergus/rsc` package for React Server Components
2. Implement `streamUI` integration for generative interfaces
3. Add server-side AI generation patterns
4. Create multi-step interface components
5. Implement generative UI state management
6. Add loading state optimization
7. Create examples for:
   - Dynamic form generation
   - Interactive dashboard creation
   - Real-time collaborative editing
   - Progressive wizard interfaces
8. Integration with AI SDK 5's RSC features

# Test Strategy:
Test RSC components work correctly on server. Verify generative UI creates proper interfaces. Test state management across server/client boundary.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RSC Package Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up separate package for React Server Components with proper build configuration.
### Details:
Create @conciergus/rsc package with server-side build configuration and RSC-specific features.

**Implementation Plan for RSC Package Structure:**

Based on AI SDK 5 documentation research, I need to create a separate `@conciergus/rsc` package structure with:

1. **Separate RSC Package Structure:**
   - Create `packages/rsc/` directory for the RSC-specific package
   - Set up proper build configuration for server components
   - Configure package.json with RSC-specific exports and dependencies
   - Update workspace configuration to include the RSC package

2. **Key RSC Components to Implement:**
   - `streamUI` integration wrapper components
   - `createStreamableUI` and `createStreamableValue` utilities
   - State management across server/client boundary using `createAI`
   - Server action wrappers for AI generation

3. **File Structure:**
   ```
   packages/rsc/
   ├── package.json
   ├── tsconfig.json
   ├── rollup.config.js
   ├── src/
   │   ├── index.ts
   │   ├── components/
   │   │   ├── ConciergusStreamUI.tsx
   │   │   ├── ConciergusServerProvider.tsx
   │   │   └── ConciergusGenerativeForm.tsx
   │   ├── hooks/
   │   │   ├── useStreamableUI.ts
   │   │   └── useServerActions.ts
   │   ├── actions/
   │   │   ├── streamActions.ts
   │   │   └── generativeActions.ts
   │   └── types/
   │       └── rsc.ts
   ```

4. **Dependencies:**
   - Core AI SDK RSC imports: `ai/rsc`
   - React Server Components support
   - Proper peer dependencies for Next.js server components

**Implementation Complete: @conciergus/rsc Package Structure**

The RSC package has been successfully implemented with the following components:

**Package Structure:**
- Created directory structure at `packages/rsc/src/{components,hooks,actions,types}`
- Configured package.json with RSC-specific exports, dependencies (AI SDK canary, React 19, Next.js 15)
- Set up tsconfig.json with proper module resolution and JSX support for server components
- Implemented rollup.config.js with multi-entry point build system for tree-shaking

**Build System:**
- Successfully configured builds for all entry points (main, actions, components, hooks)
- Generated both CommonJS and ESM formats with source maps
- Added TypeScript declarations for all modules
- Implemented proper JSX handling for server actions

**Entry Points:**
- src/index.ts - Main package exports
- src/actions.ts - Server actions entry point
- src/components.ts - React components entry point
- src/hooks.ts - React hooks entry point

**Core Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive RSC type definitions in src/types/rsc.ts
- Implemented server actions with AI SDK 5 integration
- Built foundational React components (StreamUI, ServerProvider, GenerativeForm)
- Developed React hooks for streamable UI patterns

All build outputs have been verified for correctness across formats with proper source maps and TypeScript declarations.
