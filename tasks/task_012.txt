# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement React Server Components (RSC) Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create optional RSC package for server-side AI generation and generative UI capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create `@conciergus/rsc` package for React Server Components
2. Implement `streamUI` integration for generative interfaces
3. Add server-side AI generation patterns
4. Create multi-step interface components
5. Implement generative UI state management
6. Add loading state optimization
7. Create examples for:
   - Dynamic form generation
   - Interactive dashboard creation
   - Real-time collaborative editing
   - Progressive wizard interfaces
8. Integration with AI SDK 5's RSC features

# Test Strategy:
Test RSC components work correctly on server. Verify generative UI creates proper interfaces. Test state management across server/client boundary.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RSC Package Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up separate package for React Server Components with proper build configuration.
### Details:
Create @conciergus/rsc package with server-side build configuration and RSC-specific features.

## 2. Implement StreamUI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create components that integrate with AI SDK 5's streamUI for generative user interfaces.
### Details:
Build components that can generate UI elements dynamically using AI SDK 5's streamUI capabilities.

## 3. Add Generative UI State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Implement state management for generative UI components across server/client boundary.
### Details:
Create state management system that works with RSC and handles generative UI state properly.

## 4. Create Advanced RSC Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive examples showing advanced RSC capabilities with AI generation.
### Details:
Create examples for dynamic forms, dashboards, collaborative editing, and wizard interfaces.

## 5. Add Performance Optimization for RSC [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Implement performance optimizations specific to React Server Components with AI generation.
### Details:
Optimize RSC components for performance, caching, and efficient server-side AI generation.
