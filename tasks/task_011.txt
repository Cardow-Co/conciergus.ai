# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Human Handover Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality for detecting and handling human handover requests from AI responses.
# Details:
1. Implement handover detection in tool call processing
2. Add event callback to ConciergusProvider:
```typescript
onHandoverRequired?: (chatData: {
  messages: Message[];
  lastUserMessage?: Message;
  toolInvocation?: ToolInvocation;
}) => void;
```
3. Create example implementation for common handover scenarios
4. Add documentation for integrating with human chat systems
5. Implement UI state changes during handover
6. Add support for handover cancellation
7. Create TypeScript interfaces for handover data

# Test Strategy:
Test handover detection with various tool call patterns. Verify callback is triggered with correct data. Test UI state changes during handover. Verify handover cancellation works correctly. Test integration with mock human chat systems.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Sentiment Analysis for Handover Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a sentiment analysis system to detect user frustration or complex issues that require human intervention
### Details:
Create a module that analyzes user messages for negative sentiment, confusion indicators, or explicit requests for human assistance. Integrate this with the existing tool call processing to trigger handover when appropriate thresholds are met.

## 2. Develop Context Preservation Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a system to capture and transfer the complete conversation context during handover
### Details:
Implement functionality to package conversation history, user query details, and AI response attempts into a structured format that can be passed to human agents. Ensure all relevant metadata and state information is preserved.

## 3. Create UI State Management for Handover Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement UI changes to indicate handover status, waiting periods, and agent connection
### Details:
Develop UI components and state management to show when handover is initiated, in progress, connected to an agent, or cancelled. Include appropriate loading indicators, status messages, and transition animations.

## 4. Implement Handover Cancellation Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Add support for users or system to cancel an in-progress handover request
### Details:
Create mechanisms for users to cancel a handover request before agent connection, and for the system to cancel handovers when appropriate (timeout, issue resolved, etc.). Ensure proper state restoration after cancellation.

## 5. Develop Integration Documentation and Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation and example implementations for common handover scenarios
### Details:
Document the TypeScript interfaces, event callbacks, and integration patterns for connecting with human chat systems. Provide example implementations for common scenarios like customer support, technical troubleshooting, and sales inquiries.
