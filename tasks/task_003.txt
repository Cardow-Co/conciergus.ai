# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement ConciergusChatWidget Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main chat widget container component using Radix UI Dialog for the modal interface.
# Details:
1. Create a `ConciergusChatWidget` component using Radix UI's Dialog component
2. Implement the component with the following props:
```typescript
interface ConciergusChatWidgetProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
  className?: string;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  triggerComponent?: React.ReactNode;
  headerComponent?: React.ReactNode;
  footerComponent?: React.ReactNode;
  [key: string]: any; // For ...rest props
}
```
3. Structure the component to include slots for header, content area, and footer
4. Ensure all Radix UI accessibility features are preserved
5. Pass through className and ...rest props to the root element
6. Add data-* attributes for styling hooks
7. Implement responsive behavior for mobile and desktop views

# Test Strategy:
Test the component renders correctly with various prop combinations. Verify that the dialog opens and closes as expected when isOpen changes. Test that custom trigger, header, and footer components render correctly. Verify accessibility attributes are correctly applied.
