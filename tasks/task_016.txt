## Initial Exploration & Planning (Iteration 1)

After exploring the codebase, I found that there's already a solid foundation for agent functionality in `src/context/ConciergusAgentHooks.ts`. The existing infrastructure includes:

**Existing Agent Infrastructure:**
- `AgentStep`, `AgentWorkflow`, `AgentContext` interfaces for single-agent workflows
- `useConciergusAgent` hook with workflow management capabilities  
- Agent execution pipeline with tool support and performance monitoring
- Model management and fallback chains via AI Gateway
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**What's Missing for Multi-Agent Framework:**
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer**: Currently supports only single agent workflows - need orchestration for multiple agents
2. **Agent Communication Protocol**: No inter-agent communication or handoff mechanisms
3. **Conversation Context Sharing**: Each agent operates independently - need shared conversation context
4. **Agent Selection & Routing UI**: No UI components for agent selection and switching
5. **Multi-Agent State Management**: Current state only tracks single workflow - need multi-agent conversation state

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Create Multi-Agent Context Manager** (`src/context/MultiAgentContext.tsx`):
   - Manage multiple agent instances within a single conversation
   - Handle agent handoffs and context sharing
   - Track conversation-level state across agents

2. **Enhance Agent Communication** (`src/context/AgentCommunication.ts`):
   - Define protocol for agent-to-agent handoffs
   - Implement context preservation during agent switches
   - Add inter-agent messaging capabilities

3. **Build Agent Selection UI** (`src/components/ConciergusAgentSelector.tsx`):
   - Agent picker with specialized agent profiles
   - Visual indication of current active agent
   - Smooth transition animations

4. **Create Multi-Agent Hook** (`src/hooks/useMultiAgentConversation.ts`):
   - Wrapper around existing `useConciergusAgent` for multi-agent scenarios
   - Conversation-level state management
   - Agent coordination logic

5. **Integrate with Chat Components**:
   - Update `ConciergusChatWidget` to support agent switching
   - Modify `ConciergusMessageList` to show agent attribution
   - Enhance `ConciergusChatInput` with agent-specific features

This approach leverages the existing solid agent infrastructure while adding the multi-agent orchestration layer on top.

## 2. Develop Conversation Persistence with Supabase [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a database schema and API endpoints for storing, retrieving, and managing chat history using Supabase.
### Details:

Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on conversations. Add pagination and lazy loading mechanisms for efficient history retrieval. Ensure the schema supports the multi-agent conversation model. Implement proper indexing for optimal query performance. Create mechanisms for conversation archiving and deletion with appropriate data retention policies.
<info added on 2025-05-25T13:20:52.094Z>
## Implementation Plan & Analysis

- `index.ts`: Database factory functions and chat schema generation
- Basic chat schema already exists with `conversations` and `messages` tables
- Optimized query patterns for common chat operations
- Performance monitoring and connection pooling

**What Needs Enhancement for Multi-Agent Conversations:**
1. **Enhanced Schema**: The current schema needs to support multi-agent conversations with agent tracking
2. **API Layer**: Need to build data access layer and API utilities for chat operations
3. **Multi-Agent Support**: Schema should track which agent sent each message
4. **Agent Context**: Support for agent context sharing and handoffs
5. **Pagination & Performance**: Robust pagination for large conversation histories

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Enhance Database Schema** (`src/database/ConversationSchema.ts`):
   - Extend existing schema to support multi-agent metadata
   - Add agent information and conversation context tracking
   - Include advanced indexing for search and performance

2. **Build Data Access Layer** (`src/database/ConversationDataAccess.ts`):
   - CRUD operations for conversations and messages
   - Optimized queries for pagination and search
   - Multi-agent conversation support

3. **Create API Utilities** (`src/database/ConversationAPI.ts`):
   - High-level API for conversation management
   - Integration with existing hooks and components
   - Real-time update preparation

4. **Enhanced Types** (`src/types/conversation.ts`):
   - TypeScript interfaces for multi-agent conversations
   - Message metadata structures
   - Conversation state management types

This approach leverages the existing robust database infrastructure while adding the specific enhancements needed for multi-agent conversation persistence.
