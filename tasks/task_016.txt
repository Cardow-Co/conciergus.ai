# Task ID: 16
# Title: Enhance Core Chat Functionality for Production
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced chat features required for production SaaS including multi-agent conversations, persistence, real-time collaboration, message formatting, file attachments, and search capabilities.
# Details:
This task involves implementing several critical chat enhancements to make the system production-ready:

1. Multi-agent conversation support:
   - Implement agent switching within conversations
   - Develop context management system to maintain conversation state across agents
   - Create agent selection UI and routing logic

2. Conversation persistence:
   - Design database schema for storing chat history
   - Implement API endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting conversations
   - Add pagination and lazy loading for efficient history retrieval

3. Real-time collaboration:
   - Integrate WebSocket or similar technology for real-time updates
   - Implement presence indicators showing active users
   - Add typing indicators and read receipts
   - Handle concurrent edits with conflict resolution

4. Advanced message formatting:
   - Implement Markdown parser and renderer
   - Add code syntax highlighting with support for multiple languages
   - Create rich text editor with formatting toolbar
   - Support for inline images and embeds

5. File attachment handling:
   - Implement secure file upload functionality
   - Add preview capabilities for common file types
   - Implement virus scanning and file validation
   - Handle file storage and retrieval efficiently

6. Message search and filtering:
   - Create full-text search functionality across conversations
   - Implement filters for date ranges, participants, and content types
   - Add search highlighting and result navigation
   - Optimize search performance for large conversation histories

7. Chat state management:
   - Implement robust state synchronization between clients
   - Handle offline mode and reconnection scenarios
   - Develop error handling and recovery mechanisms

This implementation should leverage the Vercel AI SDK for AI-powered features and follow React best practices. The system should be designed with scalability in mind to handle high message volumes and concurrent users.

Dependencies: This task builds upon Task 12 (RSC Integration) and should utilize the server-side AI generation capabilities established there.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this comprehensive chat functionality will require multiple approaches:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for each chat component using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Test state management logic in isolation
   - Verify formatting functions and utilities
   - Test API interaction with mock services

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the interaction between chat components
   - Verify data flow between client and server
   - Test persistence layer with a test database
   - Validate file upload and processing workflow

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create Cypress or Playwright tests for complete user flows
   - Test multi-user scenarios with multiple browser instances
   - Verify real-time updates across clients
   - Test offline functionality and reconnection

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize message rendering performance
   - Test with large conversation histories to ensure smooth scrolling
   - Benchmark search performance with various query patterns
   - Load test with simulated concurrent users

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify file upload security measures
   - Test for XSS vulnerabilities in message rendering
   - Ensure proper access controls for conversations
   - Validate data encryption for sensitive content

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Users can seamlessly switch between multiple AI agents in a conversation
   - Conversations persist across sessions with complete history
   - Multiple users can collaborate in real-time with visible presence indicators
   - Messages support full Markdown formatting with code highlighting
   - Users can attach, preview, and download files
   - Full-text search returns relevant results quickly
   - System maintains consistency across clients even with network interruptions

Document all test cases and results, and ensure that automated tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Multi-Agent Conversation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a system that supports conversations involving multiple AI agents, with proper context management and agent switching capabilities.
### Details:
Create a unified multi-agent conversation framework that allows seamless switching between different specialized agents. Implement agent selection UI with routing logic to direct messages to appropriate agents. Develop a robust context management system that maintains conversation state and history across different agents. Design protocols for inter-agent communication and collaboration. Follow patterns similar to AutoGen's framework for agent orchestration. Include capability for agents to collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback.

## 2. Develop Conversation Persistence with Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a database schema and API endpoints for storing, retrieving, and managing chat history using Supabase.
### Details:
Design an efficient database schema in Supabase for storing conversation history, including messages, metadata, and relationships between conversations and agents. Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on conversations. Add pagination and lazy loading mechanisms for efficient history retrieval. Ensure the schema supports the multi-agent conversation model. Implement proper indexing for optimal query performance. Create mechanisms for conversation archiving and deletion with appropriate data retention policies.

## 3. Integrate Real-Time Collaboration Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates, presence indicators, typing indicators, and concurrent edit handling.
### Details:
Integrate WebSocket or similar technology to enable real-time updates across clients. Implement presence indicators showing which users are currently active in a conversation. Add typing indicators that display when users are composing messages. Develop read receipts functionality to show when messages have been seen. Create a conflict resolution system to handle concurrent edits from multiple users. Ensure the system gracefully handles connection interruptions and reconnections. Optimize for minimal latency in real-time updates.
