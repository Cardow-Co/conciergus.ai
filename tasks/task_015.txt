# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Performance & Reliability Optimizations for Production Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement comprehensive performance optimization and reliability features to ensure the application can scale efficiently in production, including caching layers, database optimization, CDN setup, error handling mechanisms, and performance monitoring.
# Details:
This task involves implementing multiple layers of performance optimizations and reliability features:

1. Caching Implementation:
   - Set up Redis/Memcached as a caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies and TTL policies
   - Configure session storage in Redis if applicable
   - Document caching patterns and policies

2. Database Optimization:
   - Review and optimize existing database queries
   - Implement proper indexing strategies based on query patterns
   - Consider query caching where appropriate
   - Implement connection pooling and optimize ORM configurations
   - Document database optimization decisions

3. CDN Configuration:
   - Set up a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) for static asset delivery
   - Configure proper cache headers for different asset types
   - Implement asset versioning for cache busting
   - Optimize image delivery with proper formats and compression

4. Error Handling & Resilience:
   - Implement React error boundaries at strategic component levels
   - Create fallback UI components for graceful degradation
   - Develop timeout handling for AI API calls with appropriate user feedback
   - Implement circuit breakers for external service dependencies
   - Create a centralized error logging and notification system

5. Performance Monitoring:
   - Integrate an APM solution (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, or Elastic APM)
   - Set up custom metrics for critical application paths
   - Configure performance alerts and dashboards
   - Implement real user monitoring (RUM) for frontend performance tracking

6. Additional Optimizations:
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for frontend components
   - Configure server-side rendering optimizations in Next.js
   - Set up proper HTTP/2 and compression configurations
   - Review and optimize third-party dependencies

Reference the MCP server documentation on Next.js performance patterns, caching strategies, and monitoring tools throughout implementation. Ensure all optimizations are compatible with the security infrastructure (Task 13) and CI/CD pipeline (Task 14) already in place.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will verify both the implementation and effectiveness of performance and reliability optimizations:

1. Caching Layer Testing:
   - Unit tests for cache hit/miss logic
   - Integration tests verifying Redis/Memcached connectivity
   - Load tests comparing performance with and without caching
   - Verify cache invalidation works correctly across deployments

2. Database Optimization Testing:
   - Run EXPLAIN queries to verify index usage
   - Benchmark query performance before and after optimization
   - Test database connection pooling under load
   - Verify query execution plans are optimal

3. CDN Verification:
   - Test asset delivery through CDN vs direct server
   - Verify correct cache headers are set for different asset types
   - Test cache invalidation process for updated assets
   - Measure CDN performance across different geographic regions

4. Error Handling & Resilience Testing:
   - Simulate API failures to verify error boundaries work correctly
   - Test timeout handling by artificially delaying API responses
   - Verify circuit breaker behavior under various failure scenarios
   - Conduct chaos testing by randomly failing dependencies

5. Performance Monitoring Validation:
   - Verify APM data collection is working correctly
   - Test alert configurations with simulated performance issues
   - Validate custom metrics are reporting accurately
   - Ensure monitoring has minimal performance impact itself

6. End-to-End Performance Testing:
   - Run comprehensive load tests simulating expected production traffic
   - Measure key performance indicators (response time, throughput, error rates)
   - Conduct stress tests to identify breaking points
   - Use Lighthouse or similar tools to measure frontend performance metrics
   - Compare performance metrics before and after optimizations

7. Reliability Testing:
   - Conduct extended soak tests under normal load
   - Simulate partial system failures to verify resilience
   - Test recovery procedures from various failure scenarios
   - Verify all monitoring alerts function correctly

Document all test results with before/after comparisons to demonstrate the impact of optimizations. Include performance benchmarks in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent performance regressions.
